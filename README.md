# Robotic Arm Joint Design â€“ Enhanced Version

This project presents an improved joint design for a robotic arm, modeled using Onshape. The goal was to enhance the structural strength of the joint while maintaining the original dimensional constraints.

## Objective
Redesign the robotic arm joint to:
- Improve structural integrity and strength
- Maintain the original dimensions provided
- Prepare the model for FEA simulation and comparison

## Key Features
- Optimized geometry for better force distribution
- Clean and organized feature tree
- Ready for presentation and simulation testing
